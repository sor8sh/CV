# Live face detection

Live face detection using built-in OpenCV methods and Kalman filter.

After running `face_detection_Kalman.py`, it uses the built-in camera to start the video.

- The **red** square is for the face detection made by OpenCV `CascadeClassifier`.
- The **green** square is for the face detection made by using `Kalman` filter to reduce error.
